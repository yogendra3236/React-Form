# Form Submission App

In this project, I made a simple Form in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) that will validate the inputs according to some conditions for Name, Email-id and Password. After submitting it correctly, it will show you an alert box saying that you've successfully submitted the form. For password validation, I've used RegEx.

## Requirements and Execution

If you're using Linux based-OS, just open your terminal, and type `git clone https://github.com/yogendra3236/React-Form.git` to clone the app.<br>
Next, type in `sudo npm install` to install the necessary dependencies in your app. <br>

Now, type `npm start` to start the *localhost* server at the default port of 3000.<br>
It would automatically start your app running right in your browser, otherwise you can simply go to http://localhost:3000/ to get the result.

Happy Coding :)
